ExampleEchoServiceV1 - Example service

The echoservice-example.war contains a sample service that can be deployed into a Servlet 2.5 compatible container.

This has been tested only with Jetty 7.1.5.

Pre-Requisites:
1. Jetty High tide 7.1.5 or other compatible servlet container.
2. SOAP UI (Optional) - used to test the calls to the service.

Installation:

1. If using Jetty, unzip the WAR file into the webapps directory.
2. Start jetty from the command line:  java -jar start.jar

Note: you may want to rename the WAR to something less verbose.

Testing:
1. After jetty has been started, point your web browser to: http://localhost:8080/echoservice-example-1.0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/ExampleEchoServiceV1?WSDL
2. The web browser should return the WSDL for the service.

Using Soap UI:
1. Download Soap UI from EVIWare. http://www.soapui.org/
2. Load the TestEchoService-soapui-project.xml file into SoapUI.
3. Open the sample Request project.
4. Edit the Endpoint URL to point to where you have the service deployed.
5. Execute the request.
6. The response that is returned should contain:  <output>hello</output>
7. Change the echoText element to have a different value and resend the request.
8. ns:response should contain the new value that you just changed.
